For example, the ignition temperature of paper is lower than that of wood." },
  { q: "Give two examples each of combustible and non-combustible substances.", marks: 2, rubric: [{ step: "Two correct combustible examples", marks: 1 }, { step: "Two correct non-combustible examples", marks: 1 }], answer: "Combustible: paper, petrol, wood, cotton. Non-combustible: brick, iron nail, stone, glass." },

These dissolve in water to form carbonic and sulphurous acids, so they are acidic oxides." },
  { q: "What is smouldering? Give one example.", marks: 2, rubric: [{ step: "Definition (combustion without flame, in restricted oxygen)", marks: 1 }, { step: "Valid example (glowing coal / dying fire)", marks: 1 }], answer: "Smouldering is combustion that takes place in the absence (or restriction) of oxygen, producing no visible flame. A glowing coal or a slowly dying fire is an example." },
  { q: "State any two precautions to prevent fire caused by electrical faults.", marks: 2, rubric: [{ step: "Use of insulated / fault-free wiring", marks: 1 }, { step: "Switch off power / fuse or MCB / avoid overloading", marks: 1 }], answer: "Precautions: use properly insulated and regularly checked wiring; fit fuses or MCBs and avoid overloading circuits. Never touch switches with wet hands." },
  { q: "Draw the three zones of a candle flame and label them.", marks: 3, rubric: [{ step: "Correct labelled diagram of the three zones", marks: 2 }, { step: "Correct names: non-luminous, luminous, outermost", marks: 1 }], answer: "A candle flame has (1) the innermost non-luminous zone, (2) the luminous (yellow) zone, and (3) the outermost blue zone. The diagram should show the teardrop flame with all three zones labelled." },
  { q: "Explain why hydrogen is considered the cleanest fuel.", marks: 3, rubric: [{ step: "Combustion equation / water is the only product", marks: 2 }, { step: "No smoke or toxic gas is released", marks: 1 }], answer: "Hydrogen burns with oxygen to form only water (2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O). It produces no smoke, CO₂ or toxic gases, so it is the cleanest fuel despite its high calorific value (150 kJ/kg)." },
  { q: "What is spontaneous combustion? Give one example.", marks: 3, rubric: [{ step: "Definition (combustion without external heating)", marks: 2 }, { step: "Example (white phosphorus / dry hay or coal heaps)", marks: 1 }], answer: "Spontaneous combustion is the process in which a substance catches fire on its own, without being heated, because its ignition temperature is low. White phosphorus is the classic example." },
  { q: "Define the calorific value of a fuel and state its unit.", marks: 3, rubric: [{ step: "Definition (heat produced on complete combustion of 1 kg)", marks: 2 }, { step: "Unit: kJ/kg", marks: 1 }], answer: "The calorific value of a fuel is the amount of heat energy produced when 1 kg of the fuel burns completely. Its unit is kilojoules per kilogram (kJ/kg)." },
  { q: "Why is the outermost zone of a flame the hottest zone?", marks: 3, rubric: [{ step: "Complete combustion of fuel vapours", marks: 2 }, { step: "Sufficient supply of air in this zone", marks: 1 }], answer: "In the outermost zone, the unburnt wax vapours meet a full supply of air, so combustion is complete. Complete combustion releases the maximum heat, making this zone the hottest and giving it the blue colour." },

Explain the colour of each zone.", marks: 5, rubric: [{ step: "Correct labelled diagram", marks: 2 }, { step: "Names of the three zones", marks: 1 }, { step: "Reason for colour of each zone (dark / yellow / blue)", marks: 2 }], answer: "The innermost zone is dark (unburnt vapours), the middle luminous zone is yellow (partly burnt, glowing carbon particles), and the outermost zone is blue (complete combustion, highest temperature). A labelled teardrop diagram with all three zones must be drawn." },
  { q: "Explain the process of combustion with an example. List the conditions required for combustion to take place.", marks: 5, rubric: [{ step: "Definition of combustion", marks: 1 }, { step: "Valid example (candle, matchstick)", marks: 1 }, { step: "Conditions: combustible substance, oxygen/air, ignition temperature (any 3, each 1M)", marks: 3 }], answer: "Combustion is the process in which a substance reacts with oxygen to give off heat and light, e.g., a burning candle. Conditions: (1) a combustible substance, (2) presence of oxygen/air, and (3) temperature reaching the ignition temperature — commonly shown as the fire triangle." },
  { q: "Why is petrol stored in closed containers? Discuss the role of oxygen and ignition temperature in your answer.", marks: 5, rubric: [{ step: "Petrol is highly volatile and flammable", marks: 1 }, { step: "Vapours can mix with air and ignite", marks: 1 }, { step: "Low ignition temperature / spark risk", marks: 1 }, { step: "Closed container cuts air supply and holds vapours", marks: 1 }, { step: "Correct reasoning overall", marks: 1 }], answer: "Petrol is highly flammable with a low ignition temperature and gives off vapours readily. If stored openly, the vapours mix with air and a tiny spark can ignite them. A closed container restricts the air supply and confines the vapours, keeping the petrol safe." },
  { q: "A fire breaks out in a kitchen due to overheated oil in a pan. List the steps you would take to put it out and explain why water should not be used.", marks: 5, rubric: [{ step: "Switch off the stove / gas", marks: 1 }, { step: "Cover the pan with a lid / wet cloth to cut air", marks: 1 }, { step: "Use a CO₂ fire extinguisher if available", marks: 1 }, { step: "Water makes oil splash and spread the fire", marks: 1 }, { step: "Correct reasoning overall", marks: 1 }], answer: "First switch off the stove, then cover the pan with a lid or a damp cloth to cut off the air. A CO₂ extinguisher may be used. Water must never be poured: it sinks, boils instantly, splashes the burning oil and spreads the fire." },
  { q: "Compare wood and LPG as fuels in terms of calorific value, pollution and availability. Which would you prefer and why?", marks: 5, rubric: [{ step: "Calorific value comparison (LPG ~50 kJ/kg > wood 15–25 kJ/kg)", marks: 1 }, { step: "Pollution comparison (LPG burns cleaner, wood gives smoke)", marks: 1 }, { step: "Availability / convenience comparison", marks: 1 }, { step: "Clear preference stated", marks: 1 }, { step: "Justified reason linked to above points", marks: 1 }], answer: "Wood has a low calorific value (15–25 kJ/kg), burns with smoke, and needs space and effort. LPG has a high calorific value (~50 kJ/kg), burns cleanly and is convenient. LPG is preferred because it is efficient, less polluting and easier to store and handle." },

    answer: "Cooking utensils must conduct heat quickly and evenly from the flame to the food inside, so their bodies are made of metals like aluminium, copper, or stainless steel (good conductors). In contrast, handles must remain cool so we can safely hold and lift the vessel without getting burned, so they are made of poor conductors (insulators) like wood or thermosetting plastic (bakelite). If handles were made of metal, heat would rapidly conduct along them, burning the cook's hands.",

    answer: "Take two identical tin cans. Paint the outer surface of one can black and the other white. Pour equal quantities of water (say 100 mL) at room temperature into each can. Place a laboratory thermometer in each can and place both cans in direct sunlight for about 60 minutes. On checking the thermometers, the water in the black can is found to be noticeably hotter than that in the white can.

        "How to plot a/b:\n1. Draw the line, mark 0 and 1.\n2. For negatives use the left side; for >1 mark whole numbers first (11/4 → between 2 and 3).\n3. Divide the unit interval into |q| equal parts.\n4. Count |p| parts from the anchor (0 or the whole number).\n\nTry: 4/5, −7/4, 9/2, 2/3. Mean trick: the mean of a/b and c/d is always between them: (a/b + c/d)/2.",
